# deno-npx

Use deno through npm | npx.

Currently only supports v1.0.0 of deno, as I test and build out automation.

Inspired by [Yoshiya Hinosawa (kt3k)](https://github.com/kt3k)'s work on
[deno-bin](https://github.com/kt3k/deno-bin) but I wanted a version that meets these requirements:

1. Is built with deno (and typescript).
2. Leverages npm and optional dependencies to do most of the work.
3. Other than optional dependencies, don't fetch anything over the network.
4. Has 0 other dependencies.
5. Automate all the things.
